# FAST: Fast and Accurate Scale Estimation for Tracking
This is the matlab code of FAST [1]. The implementation is built upon the code of [2][3]. The codes provided by [4][5][6][7][8] are also used in the implementation. The results of SITUP on OTB100 are available under "Benchmark Result" folder.

## Instructions:
* 1) Modify the base_path in "run_tracker.m" with your own setting.
* 2) Run the "run_tracker.m" script in MATLAB.
* 3) Choose sequence.


## Benchmark evaluation:
run_FAST.m is the evaluation code compatiable with OTB toolkit to evaluate our tracker on the whole benchmark dataset.
